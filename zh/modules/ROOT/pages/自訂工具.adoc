GeoGebra allows you to create your own construction tools based on an existing construction. Once created, your custom
tool can be used both with the mouse and as a command in the xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar]. All tools are
automatically saved in your GeoGebra file.

[NOTE]
====
Outputs of the tool are not moveable, even if they are defined as `++Point[<Path>]++`. In case you need
moveable output, you can define a list of commands and use it with
xref:/s_index_php?title=Execute_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Execute Command].

====

== Creating custom tools

To create a custom tool, use the option xref:/Tool_Creation_Dialog.adoc[Create new tool] from
xref:/Tools_Menu.adoc[Tools Menu].

== Saving custom tools

When you save the construction as GGB file, all custom tools are stored in it. To save the tools in separate file(s) use
the xref:/Tool_Manager_Dialog.adoc[Tool Manager Dialog] (option Manage Tools from xref:/Tools_Menu.adoc[Tools Menu]).

== Accessing custom tools

If you open a new GeoGebra interface using item New from the File menu, after you created a custom tool, it will still
be part of the GeoGebra Toolbar. However, if you open a new GeoGebra window (item image:Menu_New.png[Menu
New.png,width=16,height=16] New Window from the xref:/File_Menu.adoc[File Menu]), or open GeoGebra on another day, your
custom tools won’t be part of the Toolbar any more.

There are different ways of making sure that your user defined tools are displayed in the Toolbar of a new GeoGebra
window:

After creating a new user defined tool you can save your settings using item image:Menu_Save.png[Menu
Save.png,width=16,height=16] Save Settings from the xref:/Options_Menu.adoc[Options Menu]. From now on, your customized
tool will be part of the GeoGebra Toolbar.

[NOTE]
====
You can remove the custom tool from the Toolbar after opening item Customize Toolbar… from the
xref:/Tools_Menu.adoc[Tools Menu]. Then, select your custom tool from the list of tools on the left hand side of the
appearing dialog window and click button Remove. Don’t forget to save your settings after removing the custom tool.

====

== Importing custom tools

After saving your custom tool on your computer (as a GGT file), you can import it into a new GeoGebra window at any
time. Just select item image:Menu_Open.png[Menu Open.png,width=16,height=16] Open from the xref:/File_Menu.adoc[File
Menu] and open the file of your custom tool.

[NOTE]
====

*備註：*

* Opening a GeoGebra tool file (GGT) in GeoGebra doesn’t affect your current construction. It only makes this tool part
of the current GeoGebra Toolbar.
* You can also load GGT file by dragging it from file manager and droping into GeoGebra window.
