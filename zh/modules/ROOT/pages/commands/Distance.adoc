Distance[ <Point>, <Object> ]::
Distance[Point A, Object O]::
  Yields the (shortest) distance between points _A_ and the Object. Works for Points, Segments, Lines, Conics and
  Implicit Curves. When _f_ is a function, `++Distance[A,f]++` returns distance between _A_ and _(x(A),f(x(A)))_.
Distance[Line g, Line h]::
  Yields the distance between the parallel lines _g_ and _h_.

[NOTE]
====
The distance between intersecting lines is 0. Thus, this command is only interesting for parallel lines.

[NOTE]
====
In GeoGebra 3.2 *Distance[Point A, Segment]* gave the distance to the segment extended to an infinite line.
From GeoGebra 4.0 it gives the distance to the Segment itself.
