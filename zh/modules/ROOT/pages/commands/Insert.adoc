Insert[Object, List, Position]::
  Inserts the object in the list at the given position.

[EXAMPLE]
====
 `++Insert[x^2, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, -1]++` places _x^2^_ at the end of the list and gives you the list _\{1, 2, 3,
4, 5, x^2^}_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====
 `++Insert[x^2, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 3]++` places _x^2^_ at the third position and gives you the list _\{1, 2, x^2^,
3, 4, 5}_.

If the position is a negative number, then the position is counted from the right.

last element and gives you _\{1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 5}_.
