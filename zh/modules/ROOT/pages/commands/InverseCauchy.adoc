InverseCauchy[ <Median>, <Scale>, <Probability> ]::
InverseCauchy[ <Median m>, <Scale s>, <Probability p> ]::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution[Cauchy
  distribution] at _p_, where the Cauchy distribution is given by median _m_ and scale _s_. In other words, finds _t_
  such that _P(X≤t)=p_, where X is Cauchy random variable. Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
