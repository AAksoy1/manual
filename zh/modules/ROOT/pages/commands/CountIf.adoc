CountIf[ <Condition>, <List> ]::
CountIf[Condition, List]::
  Counts the number of elements in the list satisfying the condition.

[EXAMPLE]
====


* `++CountIf[x < 3, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}]++` gives you the number 2.
* `++CountIf[x < 3, A1:A10]++`, where _A1:A10_ is a range of cells in the spreadsheet, counts all cells whose values are
less than 3.

====

[NOTE]
====
For list of numbers arbitrary condition may be used. For list of other objects one can use only conditions of
the form `++x==constant++` or `++x!=constant++`.
