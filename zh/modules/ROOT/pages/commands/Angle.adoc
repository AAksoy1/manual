Angle[ <Point>, <Apex>, <Point> ]::
Angle[ <Point>, <Apex>, <Angle> ]::

Angle[Vector v1, Vector v2]::
  Returns the angle between two vectors _v1_ and _v2_ (between 0 and 360°) .
Angle[Line g, Line h]::
  Returns the angle between the direction vectors of two lines _g_ and _h_ (between 0 and 360°) .
Angle[Point A, Point B, Point C]::
  Returns the angle enclosed by _BA_ and _BC_ (between 0 and 360°), where point _B_ is the apex.
Angle[Point A, Point B, Angle α]::
  Returns the angle of size _α_ drawn from point _A_ with apex _B_.
Angle[Conic]::
  Returns the angle of twist of a conic section’s major axis (see command
  xref:/s_index_php?title=Axes_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Axes]) .
Angle[Vector]::
  Returns the angle between the _x_‐axis and given vector.
Angle[Point]::
  Returns the angle between the _x_‐axis and the position vector of the given point.
Angle[Number]::
  Converts the number into an angle (result between 0 and 2pi).
Angle[Polygon]::
  Creates all angles of a polygon in mathematically positive orientation (i.e., counter clockwise).

[NOTE]
====
If the polygon was created in counter clockwise orientation, you get the interior angles. If the polygon was
created in clockwise orientation, you get the exterior angles.

[NOTE]
====
The point _Rotate[A, α, B]_ is created as well.
