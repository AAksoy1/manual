NSolve[ <Equation> ]::
NSolve[ <Equation> ]::
  Finds a numeric solution for a given equation for the variable x.
NSolve[ <Equation>, <Variable> ]::
  Finds a numeric solution to an equation for a given unknown variable.
NSolve[ <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> ]::
  Finds a numeric solution to a set of equations for a given set of unknown variables.

[EXAMPLE]
====


`++NSolve[{π / x = cos(x - 2y), 2 y - π = sin(x)}, {x=3, y=1.5}]++` yields _\{x = 3.141592651686591, y =
1.570796327746508}_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====


`++NSolve[a^4 + 34a^3 - 34, a]++` yields _\{a = 0.9904738886662206}_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====


`++NSolve[cos(x) = x]++` yields _\{x = 0.7390851332151606}_.

[NOTE]
====
It is optional to give the starting point like _\{x=3, y=1.5}_.
