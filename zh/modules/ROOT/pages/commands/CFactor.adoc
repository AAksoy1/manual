CFactor[ <Expression> ]::
  Factorizes a given expression, allowing for complex factors.
CFactor[ <Expression>, <Variable> ]::
  Factorizes an expression with respect to a given variable, allowing for complex factors.

[EXAMPLE]
====


`++CFactor[a^2 + x^2, x]++` yields _(x + a ί) (x - a ί)_, the factorization of _a^2^ + x^2^_ with respect to _x_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====


`++CFactor[a^2 + x^2, a]++` yields _(a + x ί) (a - x ί)_, the factorization of _a^2^ + x^2^_ with respect to _a_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====


`++CFactor[x^2 + 4]++` yields _(x + 2 ί) (x - 2 ί)_, the factorization of _x^2^ + 4_.
