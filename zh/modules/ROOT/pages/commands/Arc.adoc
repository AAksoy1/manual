Arc[Conic, Point A, Point B]::
  Returns a conic section arc between two points _A_ and _B_ on the circle or ellipse _c_. For other conics is the
  result undefined.
Arc[Conic, Number t1, Number t2]::
  Returns a conic section arc between two parameter values _t1_ and _t2_ on the circle or ellipse. For other conics is
  the result undefined.

[NOTE]
====
Internally the following parametric forms are used:

* Circle: _(r cos(t), r sin(t))_ where _r_ is the circle's radius.
* Ellipse: _(a cos(t), b sin(t))_ where _a_ and _b_ are the lengths of the semimajor and semiminor axes.
