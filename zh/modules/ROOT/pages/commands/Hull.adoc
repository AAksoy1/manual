Hull[ <List of Points> , <Percentage> ]::
Hull[ <List of Points> , <Percentage p> ]::
  Creates a characteristic hull of the points as described in http://www.geosensor.net/papers/duckham08.PR.pdf[Efficient
  generation of simple polygons for characterizing the shape of a set of points in the plane]. For _p=1_, result is the
  same as the result of xref:/s_index_php?title=ConvexHull_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[ConvexHull Command]. The
  lower percentage, the lower area of the hull. For _p=0_ the area of resulting shape is not necessarily minimal.
  Returned object is a xref:/s_index_php?title=Locus_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[locus], so it is
  xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[auxiliary].

[NOTE]
====
Values of _p_ greater than 1 are treated as 1, values less than 0 are treated as 0.
