Loci are specific object type which appears in xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[auxiliary objects].
Besides Locus command they are result of some
xref:/s_index_php?title=Discrete_Math_Commands_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Discrete Math Commands] and
xref:/s_index_php?title=SolveODE_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[SolveODE Command]. Loci are
xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[paths] and can be used within path-related commands such as
xref:/Point_Command.adoc[Point]. Their properties depend on how they were obtained, see e.g.
xref:/Perimeter_Command.adoc[Perimeter Command] and
xref:/s_index_php?title=First_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[First Command].
