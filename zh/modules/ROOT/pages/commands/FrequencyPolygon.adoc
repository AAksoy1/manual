[NOTE]
====
Frequency polygon is a line graph drawn by joining all the midpoints of the top of the bars of a histogram.
Therefore usage of this command is the same as usage of
xref:/s_index_php?title=Histogram_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Histogram Command].

====

FrequencyPolygon[<List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Heights>]::
  Creates a frequency polygon with vertices in given heights. The class boundaries determine the x-coordinate of each
  vertex.

For examples see xref:/s_index_php?title=Histogram_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Histogram Command].

FrequencyPolygon[<List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density>, <Density Scale
Factor>(optional)]::
  Creates a frequency polygon using the raw data. The class boundaries determine the x-coordinates of vertices and are
  used to determine how many data elements lie in each class. The y-coordinate of a vertex is determined as follows

* If _Use Density = true_, height = (Density Scale Factor) * (class frequency) / (class width)
* If _Use Density = false_, height = class frequency

By default, Use Density = true and Density Scale Factor = 1.

FrequencyPolygon[ <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density> , <Density
Scale Factor> (optional) ]::
  If Cumulative is true this creates a frequency polygon where each vertex y-coordinate equals the frequency of the
  class plus the sum of all previous frequencies.
