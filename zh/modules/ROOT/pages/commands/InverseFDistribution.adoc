InverseFDistribution[ <Numerator Degrees of Freedom>, <Denominator Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> ]::
InverseFDistribution[ <Numerator Degrees of Freedom n>, <Denominator Degrees of Freedom d>, <Probability p> ]::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution[F-distribution] at _p_, where the exponential distribution is given by
  parameters _n, d_. In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X≤t)=p_, where X is random variable with F-distribution.
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
