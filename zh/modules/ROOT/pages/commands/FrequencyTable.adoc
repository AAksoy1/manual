FrequencyTable[ <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Heights> ]::
FrequencyTable[ <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor>
(optional) ]::
FrequencyTable[ <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Boolean Use Density> , <Density
Scale Factor> (optional) ]::
FrequencyTable[ <List of Raw Data L> ]::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains sorted list of unique elements of _L_ and second column contains
  the count of the occurrences of value in the first column. List _L_ can be numbers or text.

FrequencyTable[ <Boolean Cumulative C>, <List of Raw Data L>]::
  If _Cumulative = false_, returns the same table as Frequency[ <L> ]
  If _Cumulative = true_, returns a table whose first column is the same as in FrequencyTable[L] and the second contains
  cumulative frequencies of values in the first column.

FrequencyTable[<List of Class Boundaries C>, <List of Raw Data L> ]::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains intervals (classes) and second column contains the count of
  numbers in _L_ which belong to the interval in the first column. All intervals except the highest interval are of the
  form [a, b). The highest interval has the form [a, b].

FrequencyTable[ <Boolean Cumulative>,<List of Class Boundaries C>,<List of Raw Data L>]::
  If _Cumulative = false_, returns the same table as FrequencyTable[ <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data> ]
  If _Cumulative = true_, returns a table whose first column is the same as in FrequencyTable[L] and the second contains
  cumulative frequencies of values in the first column.

FrequencyTable[<List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor> (optional) ]::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains intervals (classes) and second contains frequencies for the
  corresponding xref:/s_index_php?title=Histogram_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Histogram Command].

FrequencyTable[ <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Use Density> , <Density Scale
Factor> (optional) ]::
  Returns a table (as text) whose first column contains intervals (classes) and second contains frequencies for the
  corresponding xref:/s_index_php?title=Histogram_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Histogram Command].
