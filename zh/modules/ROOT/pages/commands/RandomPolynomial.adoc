RandomPolynomial[ <Degree> , <Minimum for Coefficients>, <Maximum for Coefficients> ]::
RandomPolynomial[ <Variable>, <Degree> , <Minimum for Coefficients>, <Maximum for Coefficients> ]::
RandomPolynomial[ <Degree d> , <Minimum for Coefficients min>, <Maximum for Coefficients max> ]::
  Returns a randomly generated polynomial in _x_ of degree _d_, whose (integer) coefficients are in the range from _min_
  to _max_, both included.

[EXAMPLE]
====


* `++RandomPolynomial[0, 1, 2]++` yields either _1_ or _2_ and
* `++RandomPolynomial[2, 1, 2]++` yields a random polynomial with a degree of two and only _1_ and _2_ as coefficients,
for example _2x^2^ + x + 1_.

====

RandomPolynomial[ <Variable Var>, <Degree d> , <Minimum for Coefficients min>, <Maximum for Coefficients max> ]::
  Returns a randomly generated polynomial in _Var_ of degree _d_, whose (integer) coefficients are in the range from
  _min_ to _max_, both included.

[EXAMPLE]
====


* `++RandomPolynomial[a, 0, 1, 2]++` yields either _1_ or _2_ and
* `++RandomPolynomial[a, 2, 1, 2]++` yields a random polynomial with a degree of two and only _1_ and _2_ as
coefficients, for example _2a^2^ + a + 1_.

====

[NOTE]
====
In both cases if _min_ or _max_ are not integers, _round(min)_ and _round(max)_ are used instead.
