InverseChiSquared[ <Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> ]::
InverseChiSquared[ <Degrees of Freedom d>, <Probability p> ]::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution[Chi
  squared distribution] at _p_, where the Chi squared distribution has given _d_ degrees of freedom. In other words,
  finds _t_ such that _P(X≤t)=p_, where X is Chi squared random variable. Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
