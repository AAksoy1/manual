HistogramRight[ <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Heights> ]::
HistogramRight[ <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor> (optional) ]::
HistogramRight[ <Boolean Cumulative>, <List of Class Boundaries>, <List of Raw Data>, <Use Density> , <Density Scale
Factor> (optional) ]::
HistogramRight[ <List of Class Boundaries B>, <List of Heights H> ]::
  Same as `++Histogram[B,H]++`
HistogramRight[ <List of Class Boundaries B>, <List of Raw Data D>, <Boolean Use Density> , <Density Scale Factor f>
(optional) ]::
  Same as `++Histogram[B,D,Use Density, f]++`, except that if a datum is equal to the right border of a class, it is
  counted in this class and not in the next one.
