InverseExponential[ <Lambda>, <Probability> ]::
InverseExponential[ <Mean λ>, <Probability p> ]::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution[exponential distribution] at _p_, where the exponential
  distribution is given by mean _λ_. In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X≤t)=p_, where X is exponential random
  variable. Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
