KeepIf[ <Condition>, <List> ]::
KeepIf[Condition, List]::
  Creates a new list that only contains those elements of the initial list that fulfil the condition.

[EXAMPLE]
====
 `++KeepIf[x<3, {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6}]++` returns the new list _\{1, 2, 1}_.

====

[NOTE]
====
For list of numbers arbitrary condition may be used. For list of other objects one can use only conditions of
the form `++x==constant++` or `++x!=constant++`.
