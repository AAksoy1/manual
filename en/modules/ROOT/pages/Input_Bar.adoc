== Input Bar and Algebra Input

In GeoGebra Desktop, the _Input Bar_ is by default located in the bottom of GeoGebra window. You can show it or hide it
using the xref:/View_Menu.adoc[View Menu] or can xref:/GeoGebra_5_0_Desktop_vs_Web_and_Tablet_App.adoc[change it's
position] within the GeoGebra window.

In the GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps an _Algebra Input_ is integrated directly into the
image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View].
Therefore, the _Input Bar_ is not displayed by default if the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view
algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] _Algebra View_ is part of the GeoGebra window. However, the _Input Bar_ can be shown
using the image:16px-Menu-view.svg.png[Menu-view.svg,width=16,height=16] _View Menu_, replacing the _Input Field_.

Both, the _Input Bar_ and _Algebra Input_ are providing the same functionalities in GeoGebra. However, the _Algebra
Input_ additionally features an _Equation Editor_, which makes it easier for you to enter equations and expressions.

== Algebraic Input and Commands

The _Input Bar_ allows you to directly create and xref:/Redefine_Dialog.adoc[redefine] mathematical objects in the
image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] _Algebra View_ by entering or modifying
their algebraic representations (e.g. values, coordinates, equations).

[EXAMPLE]
====

The input `++f(x) = x^2++` gives you the function _f_ in the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view
algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] _Algebra View_ and its function graph in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu
view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View].

====

[NOTE]
====

Always press [.kcode]#Enter# after typing algebraic input into the _Input Bar_.

====

Additionally, you may input xref:/Commands.adoc[Commands] in order to easily create new or work with existing objects.
For more information, please see xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[Geometric Objects] and xref:/General_Objects.adoc[General
Objects].

[EXAMPLE]
====

Typing `++A=(1,1)++` and hitting the [.kcode]#Enter# key creates a xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free]
point _A_ with coordinates (1, 1). Create another free point `++B=(3,4)++` in the same way. Then, type in
`++Line(A, B)++` in order to create a xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[dependent] line through both
points _A_ and _B_.

====

You can toggle the focus between the _Input Bar_ and the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ at any time by pressing the [.kcode]#Enter# key. This allows you to
enter expressions and commands into the _Input Bar_ without having to click on it first.

== Displaying Input History

After placing the cursor in the _Input Bar_ you can use the [.kcode]#↑# up and [.kcode]#↓# down arrow keys on your
keyboard in order to navigate through prior input step by step. Hit the [.kcode]#Enter# key in order to transfer the
selected prior input back into the _Input Bar_.

== Insert Name, Value, or Definition of an Object into the Input Bar of the GeoGebra Desktop Version

*Insert the name of an object*: Activate the image:20px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=20,height=20]xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool] and select the object whose name you want to insert into
the _Input Bar_. Then, press [.kcode]#F5# on your keyboard.

[NOTE]
====

The name of the object is appended to any expression you typed into the _Input Bar_ before pressing [.kcode]#F5#.

====

*Insert the value of an object*: To insert an object’s value (e.g. coordinates of a point `++(1, 3)++`, equation
`++3x – 5y = 12++`) into the _Input Bar_, select the image:20px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=20,height=20] __Move Tool__ and click on the object whose value you want to insert into the _Input Bar_.
Then, press [.kcode]#F4# on your keyboard.

[NOTE]
====

The value of the object is appended to any expression you typed into the _Input Bar_ before pressing [.kcode]#F4#.

====

*Insert the definition of an object*: There are two ways of inserting an object’s definition (e.g. `++A = (4, 2)++`,
`++c = Circle(A, B)++`) into the _Input Bar_.

* Hold the [.kcode]#Alt# key and select the object to insert the object’s definition and delete whatever input might
have been in the _Input Bar_ before.
* Activate the image:20px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode move.svg,width=20,height=20] _xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool]_ and
select the object whose definition you want to insert into the _Input Bar_. Then, press [.kcode]#F3# on your keyboard.

[NOTE]
====

The definition of the object replaces any expression you typed into the _Input Bar_ before pressing [.kcode]#F3#.
