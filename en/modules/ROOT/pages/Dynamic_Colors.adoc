In GeoGebra, you can change the objects' colour using the _Colour_ tab of the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog].
The colour of an object can also be set to change dynamically: open the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_ of the object whose colour you
would like to define, then select the _Advanced_ tab. The _Dynamic Colours_ sections contains three input boxes which
allow you to enter the main colour's components: _Red_, _Green_, and _Blue_.

[NOTE]
====

* The RGB values of the main colours are displayed to the right of the _Preview_ box in the _Colour_ tab of the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_.
* Dynamic colours can also be defined entering a function with range [0,1].

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

* Create three xref:/tools/Slider.adoc[sliders] a, b, and c with an interval from 0 to 1.
* Create a polygon, whose colour will be dynamically related to the sliders values.
* Open the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_ for the polygon,
then enter the names of the three sliders into the _Red_, _Green_ and _Blue_ input boxes.
* Close the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_ and change the
values of the sliders in order to find out how each colour component influences the resulting colour of the polygon.

[NOTE]
====

You may also xref:/Animation.adoc[animate] the sliders with different speeds, in order to see the colour of the polygon
change automatically.

====

====

The _Dynamic Colours_ section also contains an input box which allows you to change the _Opacity_ of the selected
object. You can enter a number ranging in [0,1] (where 0 means transparent, and 1 means 100% opaque), as well as a
slider, in order to obtain a dynamic opacity. Other numbers will be ignored.

== RGB / HSV / HSL

Some dynamic colouring patterns can be obtained using a different colour model. Besides the default
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB[RGB], GeoGebra offers two more models, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV[HSV]
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV[HSL], that can be selected in the drop down list displayed at the bottom of
the _Dynamic Colours_ section of the _Advanced_ tab of the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

To make a point _A_ go through all the colours of the rainbow when moved left and right, switch to _HSV_ mode, then set
_Saturation_ and _Value_ to 1, and _Hue_ to `++x(A)++`.
