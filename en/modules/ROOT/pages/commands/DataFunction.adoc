DataFunction( <List of Numbers>, <List of Numbers> )::
  Yields a function that connects points (x~1~, y~1~), (x~2~, y~2~),...,(x~n~, y~n~) where {x~1~, ..., x~n~}, {y~1~,
  ..., y~n~} are the input lists. In between these points linear interpolation is used. This command is used by Sensors.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++DataFunction({0, 1, 2, 4}, {0, 1, 4, 16})++` yields a function that goes through points (0, 0), (1,1), (2, 4), (4,
16).
