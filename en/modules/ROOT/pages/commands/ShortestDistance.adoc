ShortestDistance( <List of Segments>, <Start Point>, <End Point>, <Boolean Weighted> )::
  Finds shortest path between start point and endpoint in a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)[graph]
  given by list of segments. If weighted is false,
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_graph#Weighted_graphs_and_networks[weight] of each edge is supposed to be 1
  (i.e. we are looking for the path with least number of edges), otherwise it is the length of given segment (we are
  looking for the geometrically shortest path).
