HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>)::
  Returns a bar graph of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution[Hypergeometric distribution].
  _Parameters:_
  _Population size_: number of balls in the urn
  _Number of Successes_: number of white balls in the urn
  _Sample Size_: number of balls drawn from the urn

The bar graph shows the probability function of the number of white balls in the sample.

HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Returns a bar graph of a Hypergeometric distribution when _Cumulative_ = false.
  Returns the graph of a cumulative Hypergeometric distribution when _Cumulative_ = true.
  First three parameters are same as above.

HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Let X be a Hypergeometric random variable and v the variable value.
  Returns P( X = _v_) when _Cumulative_ = false.
  Returns P( X ≤ _v_) when _Cumulative_ = true.
  First three parameters are same as above.

only the following syntax:

HyperGeometric( <Population Size>, <Number of Successes>, <Sample Size>, <Variable Value>, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  Let X be a Hypergeometric random variable and v the variable value.
  Returns P( X = _v_) when _Cumulative_ = false.
  Returns P( X ≤ _v_) when _Cumulative_ = true.
  The first three parameters are the same as above.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Assume you select two balls out of ten balls, two of which are white, without putting any back.

* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 0, false)++` yields stem:[\frac{28}\{45}], the probability of selecting zero white balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 1, false)++` yields stem:[\frac{16}\{45}], the probability of selecting one white ball,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 2, false)++` yields stem:[\frac{1}\{45}], the probability of selecting both white balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 3, false)++` yields _0_, the probability of selecting three white balls.
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 0, true)++` yields stem:[\frac{28}\{45}], the probability of selecting zero (or less)
white balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 1, true)++` yields stem:[\frac{44}\{45}], the probability of selecting one or less white
balls,
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 2, true)++` yields _1_, the probability of selecting two or less white balls and
* `++HyperGeometric(10, 2, 2, 3, true)++` yields _1_, the probability of selecting three or less white balls.
