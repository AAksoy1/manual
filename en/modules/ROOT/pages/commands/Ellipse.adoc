Ellipse( <Focus>, <Focus>, <Semimajor Axis Length> )::
  Creates an ellipse with two focal points and semimajor axis length.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Ellipse((0, 1), (1, 1), 1)++` yields _12x² + 16y² - 12x - 32y = -7_.

====

[NOTE]
====

If the condition: _2*semimajor axis length > Distance between the focus points_ isn't met, you will get an hyperbola.

====

Ellipse( <Focus>, <Focus>, <Segment> )::
  Creates an ellipse with two focal points, where the length of the semimajor axis equals the length of the given
  segment.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _s = Segment\((0,1), (2,1))_ : `++Ellipse((0, 1), (2, 1), s)++` yields _3x² + 4y² - 6x - 8y = 5_.

====

Ellipse( <Focus>, <Focus>, <Point> )::
  Creates an ellipse with two focal points passing through a given point.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Ellipse((0, 1), (2, 1), (1,2))++` yields _1x² + 2y² - 2x - 4y = -1_.
