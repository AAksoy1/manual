Payment( <Rate>, <Number of Periods>, <Present Value>, <Future Value (optional)>, <Type (optional)> )::
  Calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.

* *<Rate>* Interest rate per period.
* *<Number of Periods>* Total number of payments for the loan.
* *<Present Value>* Total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.
* *<Future Value (optional)>* A cash balance you want to attain after the last payment. If you do not enter a future
value, it is assumed to be 0.
* *<Type (optional)>* Indicates when payments are due. If you do not enter a value or you enter 0 the payment is due at
the end of the period. If you enter 1 it is due at the beginning of the period.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Payment(6%/12, 10, 10000, 0,1)++` yields a monthly payment for a loan of -1022.59.
====

[NOTE]
====

Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for `++<Rate>++` and `++<Number of Periods>++`. If you make
monthly payments on a four-year loan at an annual interest rate of 6 percent, use 6%/12 for rate and 4*12 for number of
payments.
