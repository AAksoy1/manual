RotateText( <Text>, <Angle> )::
  Returns text rotated by given angle. xref:/LaTeX.adoc[LaTeX] is used for rendering of the result.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++RotateText("a = 5", 45째)++`

====

[NOTE]
====

* The text needs to be enclosed in double quotes `++"++`.
* The text is rotated around the top left corner (also known as corner 4) of the box containing the text, and placed at
the origin of the coordinate system.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

If you want to place the text "GeoGebra", rotated by 42째, at point (6,6), use the command
`++Text(RotateText("GeoGebra", 42째), (6, 6),true,true)++`

====

[NOTE]
====
* The angle is in radians unless you explicitly use the degree symbol `++째++`.
