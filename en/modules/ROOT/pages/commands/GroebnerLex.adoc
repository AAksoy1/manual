== CAS Syntax

GroebnerLex( <List of Polynomials> )::
  Computes the Gröbner basis of the list of the polynomials with respect to lexicographical ordering of the variables
  (also known as _lex_, _plex_ or _pure lexical_ ordering).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++GroebnerLex({x^3-y-2,x^2+y+1})++` yields {stem:[ y^{3} + 4 y^{2} + 7 y + 5, x - y^{2} - 3 y - 3 ]}.

====

GroebnerLex( <List of Polynomials>, <List of Variables> )::
  Computes the Gröbner basis of the list of the polynomials with respect to lexicographical ordering of the given
  variables (also known as _lex_, _plex_ or _pure lexical_ ordering).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++GroebnerLex({x^3-y-2,x^2+y+1},{y,x})++` yields {stem:[ -x^{3} - x^{2} + 1, -y - x^{2} - 1 ]}.
