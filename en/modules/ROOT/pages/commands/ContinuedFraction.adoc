ContinuedFraction( <Number> )::
  Creates http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction[continued fraction] of given number. The result is a LaTeX
  xref:/Texts.adoc[text object]. The fraction is computed numerically within precision 10^-8^.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ContinuedFraction(5.45)++` gives _stem:[5 + \frac{1}\{ 2+ \frac{1}\{4+ \frac{1}\{ 1+ \frac{1}\{ 1 } } } }]_

====

ContinuedFraction( <Number>, <Level> )::
  Creates continued fraction of given number. Number of quotients is less than or equal to _Level_, but never exceeds
  the number of quotients needed to achieve the precision mentioned above.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ContinuedFraction(5.45, 3)++` gives _stem:[5 + \frac{1}\{ 2+ \frac{1}\{4+ ... } }]_

====

ContinuedFraction( <Number>, <Level>, <Shorthand true|false> )::
  Meaning of first two arguments is same as above, the argument _Level_ is optional. When _Shorthand_ is true, shorter
  syntax for the result is used: the LaTeX text contains a list of the integer parts of the continued fraction.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++ContinuedFraction(5.45, true)++` gives [_5; 2, 4, 1, 1_]
* `++ContinuedFraction(5.45, 3, true)++` gives [_5; 2, 4, ..._]
