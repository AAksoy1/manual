TiedRank( <List> )::
  Returns a list, whose _i_-th element is the rank of _i_-th element of the given list _L_ (rank of element is its
  position in xref:/commands/Sort.adoc[Sort](L)). If there are more equal elements in _L_ which occupy positions from
  _k_ to _l_ in Sort[L], the mean of the ranks from _k_ to _l_ are associated with these elements.
