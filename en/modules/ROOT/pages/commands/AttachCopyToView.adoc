AttachCopyToView( <Object>, <View 0|1|2> )::
  If _View = 0_, a copy of given object is created. For _View = 1_ or _View = 2_ this command creates a dependent copy
  of given object whose size in given image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
  xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View] is constant.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++poly = Polygon((0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1))++`. If Graphics View 1 is active, `++AttachCopyToView(poly, 1)++`
creates a square with the same size at the same position.

====

[NOTE]
====

Once the copy is created, four more arguments are added to the command definition.

AttachCopyToView( <Object>, <View 0|1|2>, <Point 1>, <Point 2>, <Screen Point 1>, <Screen Point 2> )::

If _View = 0_, a copy of given object is created. For _View = 1_ or _View = 2_ this command creates a dependent copy of
given object whose size in given image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View] is transformed using the affine transform that maps _Point 1_ to a point whose
screen coordinates (in pixels) are equal to _Screen Point 1_, and _Point 2_ to a point with screen coordinates equal to
_Screen Point 2_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++poly = Polygon((0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1))++`. If Graphics View 1 is active,
`++AttachCopyToView(poly, 1, (0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0), (100, 100))++` creates a _100px x 100px_ square in the top left
corner of the Graphics View.

====

[NOTE]
====

All points of the object are copied, even if they lie outside the view.
