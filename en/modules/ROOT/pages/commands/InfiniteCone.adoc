InfiniteCone( <Point>, <Vector>, <Angle α> )::
  Creates an infinite cone with given point as vertex, axis of symmetry parallel to the given vector and apex angle
  _2α_.
InfiniteCone( <Point>, <Point>, <Angle α> )::
  Creates an infinite cone with given first point as vertex, line through two points as axis of symmetry and apex angle
  _2α_.
InfiniteCone( <Point>, <Line>, <Angle α> )::
  Creates an infinite cone with given point as vertex, axis of symmetry parallel to given line and apex angle _2α_.

[NOTE]
====

* If you enter the angle without the degree symbol, you will get the apex angle in radian.
