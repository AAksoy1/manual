RandomBetween( <Minimum Integer> , <Maximum Integer> )::
  Generates a random integer between _minimum_ and _maximum_ (inclusive).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++RandomBetween(0, 10)++` yields a number between _0_ and _10_ (inclusive)

====

RandomBetween( <Minimum Integer> , <Maximum Integer> , <Boolean Fixed> )::
  If _Boolean Fixed_ = "true", it generates a random integer between _minimum_ and _maximum_ (inclusive), which is
  updated just once (when file is loaded and also on undo/redo).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++RandomBetween(0, 10, true)++` yields a number between _0_ and _10_ (inclusive)

====

RandomBetween( <Minimum Integer> , <Maximum Integer>, <Number of Samples> )::
  Generates a list of random integers between _minimum_ and _maximum_ (inclusive). The number of random integers in the
  list is the _number of samples_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++RandomBetween(0, 10, 5)++` yields {1,3,4,8,2}, or {7,5,6,1,7}, etc.
