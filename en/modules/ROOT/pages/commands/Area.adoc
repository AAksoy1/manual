Area( <Point>, ..., <Point> )::
  Calculates the area of the polygon defined by the given points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Area((0, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (0, 2))++` yields _6_.

====

Area( <Conic> )::
  Calculates the area of a conic section (circle or ellipse).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Area(x^2 + y^2 = 2)++` yields _6.28_.

====

Area( <Polygon> )::
  Calculates the area of the polygon.

[NOTE]
====

* for Polygons, the absolute value of the Algebraic Area is calculated (which gives unexpected answers for
self-intersecting polygons)
* In order to calculate the area between two function graphs, you need to use the command
xref:/commands/IntegralBetween.adoc[IntegralBetween].
* See also the image:24px-Mode_area.svg.png[Mode area.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Area.adoc[Area] tool.
