LimitAbove( <Function>, <Value> )::
  Computes the right https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function#One-sided_limits[one-sided limit] of the function
  for the given value of the main function variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LimitAbove(1 / x, 0)++` yields _stem:[\infty]_ .

====

[NOTE]
====

Not all limits can be calculated by GeoGebra, so _undefined_ will be returned in those cases (as well as when the
correct result is undefined).

== CAS Syntax

LimitAbove( <Expression>, <Value> )::
  Computes the right one-sided limit of the function for the given value of the main function variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LimitAbove(1 / x, 0)++` yields stem:[\infty] .

====

LimitAbove( <Expression>, <Variable>, <Value> )::
  Computes the right one-sided limit of the multivariate function for the given value of the given function variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LimitAbove(1 / a, a, 0)++` yields stem:[\infty] .

====

[NOTE]
====

Not all limits can be calculated by GeoGebra, so _?_ will be returned in those cases (as well as when the correct result
is undefined).
