TTest2( <List of Sample Data 1>, <List of Sample Data 2>, <Tail>, <Boolean Pooled> )::
  Performs a t-test of the difference between two population means using the given lists of sample data. Tail has
  possible values "<", ">" , "≠" that determine the following alternative hypotheses:
  "<" = difference in population means < 0
  ">" = difference in population means > 0
  "≠" = difference in population means ≠ 0

If _Pooled_ = true, then population variances are assumed equal and sample standard deviations are combined in
calculation.

If _Pooled_ = false, then population variances are not assumed equal and sample standard deviations are not combined.

Results are returned in list form as _\{Probabilty value, t-test statistic}_.

TTest2( <Sample Mean 1>, <Sample Standard Deviation 1>, <Sample Size 1>, <Sample Mean 2>, <Sample Standard Deviation 2>,<Sample Size 2>, <Tail>, <Boolean Pooled> )::
  Performs a t-test of the difference between two population means using the given sample statistics. _Tail_ and
  _Pooled_ are defined as above. Results are returned in list form as _\{Probabilty value, t-test statistic}_.
