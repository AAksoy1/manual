ChiSquaredTest( <Matrix> )::
  Performs a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test[chi-squared test] that compares the given matrix of observed
  counts against the matrix of expected counts determined by the hypothesis of independence.
  The matrix of expected counts is calculated internally. Each expected count is found from the row and column totals of
  the given matrix of observed counts using the rule:
  stem:[ \text{expected count} = \frac{\text{row total} Ã— \text{column total}}{\text{total observed counts}} ]

Results are returned in list form as _{Probability value, chi-squared test statistic}_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ChiSquaredTest({{1, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 3}})++` yields _{0.69, 0.75}_.

====

ChiSquaredTest( <Observed List>, <Expected List> )::
  Performs a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit[Goodness of Fit test] that compares the given list of observed
  counts against the given list of expected counts.
  Results are returned in list form as _{Probability value, chi-squared test statistic}_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ChiSquaredTest({1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 2, 4, 2})++` yields _{0.31, 3.58}_.

====

ChiSquaredTest( <Observed Matrix>, <Expected Matrix> )::
  Performs a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test[chi-squared test] that compares the given matrix of observed
  counts against the given matrix of expected counts.
  Results are returned in list form as _{Probability value, chi-squared test statistic}_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ChiSquaredTest({{1, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 3}}, {{2, 3, 2}, {4, 2, 3}})++` yields _{0.45, 1.58}_.
