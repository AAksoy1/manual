  Calculates the left sum of the function in the interval using _n_ rectangles.

`++LeftSum(x^2 + 1, 0, 2, 4)++` yields _a_ = 3.75

[NOTE]
====

* This command draws the rectangles of the left sum as well.
* This command is designed as a visual aid so won't give accurate answers if the number of rectangles is too large.
* See also the commands: xref:/commands/RectangleSum.adoc[RectangleSum],
