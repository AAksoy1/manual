Sort( <List> )::
  Sorts a list of numbers, text objects, or points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Sort({3, 2, 1})++` gives you the list _{1, 2, 3}_.
* `++Sort({"pears", "apples", "figs"})++` gives you the list elements in alphabetical order.
* `++Sort({(3, 2), (2, 5), (4, 1)}) ++` gives you _{(2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 1)}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

Lists of points are sorted by _x_-coordinates.

====

Sort( <Values>, <Keys> )::
  Sorts the first list _Values_ according to the corresponding second list _Keys_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* In order to sort a list of polynomials `++list1 = {x^3, x^2, x^6}++` according to degree, create the dependent list of
degrees `++list2 = Zip(Degree(a), a, list1)++`. After that, `++ Sort(list1, list2)++` yields the requested _list3 =
{x^2, x^3, x^6}_.
* In order to draw the polygon having as vertices the complex roots of stem:[x^\{10}-1], sorted by their arguments,
create `++list1 = {ComplexRoot(x^10-1)}++`, then use the command `++Polygon(Sort(list1, arg(list1)))++`. This command
yields _poly1 = 2.94_.
