InverseGamma( <Alpha>, <Beta>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of the Gamma cumulative distribution with parameters _α_ and _β_ for a given probability _p_.
  In other words, the command finds t such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a random variable with a Gamma distribution. Probability _p_ is any value in the interval [0,1].
