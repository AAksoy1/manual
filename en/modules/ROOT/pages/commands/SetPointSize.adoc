SetPointSize( <Point>, <Number> )::
  Changes the size of the point.
SetPointSize( <Polygon>, <Number> )::
  Changes the size of a polygon's points.
SetPointSize( <Polyhedron>, <Number> )::
  Changes the size of a polyhedron's points.
SetPointSize( <Net>, <Number> )::
  Changes the size of a net's points.

[NOTE]
====

Also works for lists of (unlabeled) points, e.g. let _++list={(1, 2), (3, 4)}++_.
Then `++SetPointSize(list,5)++` changes the size of the listed points.
