== CAS Syntax

CSolutions( <Equation> )::
  Solves a given equation for the main variable and returns a list of all solutions, allowing for complex solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++CSolutions(x^2 = -1)++` yields _\{ί, -ί}_, the complex solutions of _x^2^ = -1_.

====

CSolutions( <Equation>, <Variable> )::
  Solves an equation for a given unknown variable and returns a list of all solutions, allowing for complex solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++CSolutions(a^2 = -1, a)++` yields _\{ί, -ί}_, the complex solutions of _a^2^ = -1_.

====

CSolutions( <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Solves a set of equations for a given set of unknown variables and returns a list of all solutions, allowing for
  complex solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++CSolutions({y^2 = x - 1, x = 2 * y - 1}, {x, y})++` yields stem:[\begin{pmatrix}1 + 2 ί&1 + ί\\1 - 2 ί&1 -
ί\end{pmatrix}], the complex solutions of _y^2^ = x - 1_ and _x = 2 * y - 1_.

====

[NOTE]
====

*Notes:*

* The complex ί is obtained by pressing [.kcode]#ALT# + [.kcode]#i#.
* See also xref:/commands/CSolve.adoc[CSolve Command] and xref:/commands/Solutions.adoc[Solutions Command].
