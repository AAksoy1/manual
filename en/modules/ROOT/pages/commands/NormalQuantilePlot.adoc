NormalQuantilePlot( <List of Raw Data> )::
  Creates a normal quantile plot from the given list of data and draws a line through the points showing the ideal plot
  for exactly normal data. Points are formed by plotting data values on the x axis against their expected normal score
  (Z-score) on the y axis. More precisely the y-values are computed using Filliben's estimate.
