Spline( <List of Points> )::
  Creates a cubic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)[spline] through all points.
Spline( <List of Points>, <Order ≥ 3> )::
  Creates a spline with given order through all points.
Spline( <List of Points>, <Order ≥ 3>, <Weight Function> )::
  Creates a spline with given order through all points. The weight function says what should be the difference of _t_
  values for point __P__~i~ and __P__~i+1~ given their difference __P__~i+1~ - __P__~i~ = (_x_, _y_). To get the spline
  you expect from "function" algorithm you should use `++abs(x)+0*y++`, to get the GeoGebra's default spline you can use
  `++sqrt(x^2+y^2)++`.

[NOTE]
====

The choice of default makes the result behave nicely when transformed, making sure that `++Rotate(Spline(list), a)++`
gives the same as `++Spline(Rotate(list, a))++`.
