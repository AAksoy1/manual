= Min Command

ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Min( <List> )::
  Returns the minimum of the numbers within the list.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min({-2, 12, -23, 17, 15})++` yields _-23_.

====

[NOTE]
====

If the input consists of non-numeric objects, then this command considers the numbers associated with those objects. If
you have a list of segments for example, the command Min( <List> ) will yield the minimum segment length.

====

Min( <Interval> )::

Returns the lower bound of the interval.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min(2 < x < 3)++` yields _2_ .

====
[NOTE]
====

Open and closed intervals are not distinguished.

====


Min( <Number>, <Number> )::

Returns the minimum of the two given numbers.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min(12, 15)++` yields _12_.

====


Min( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Calculates (numerically) the *local* minimum point for function in the given interval. Function should be continuous
  and have only one _local_ minimum point in the interval (and no local maximum).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min(exp(x) x^3,-4,-2)++` creates the point (-3, -1.34425) .

====

[NOTE]
====

For polynomials you should use the xref:/commands/Extremum.adoc[Extremum Command].

====

Min( <List of Data>, <List of Frequencies> )::
  Returns the minimum of the list of data with corresponding frequencies.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {0, 3, 4, 2, 3})++` yields 2, the lowest number of the first list whose frequency is greater
than 0.

====

[NOTE]
====

* If you want the minimum of two functions `++f(x)++` and `++g(x)++` then you can define
`++(f(x) + g(x) - abs(f(x) - g(x)))/2++`
* See also xref:/commands/Max.adoc[Max Command], xref:/commands/Extremum.adoc[Extremum Command] and
xref:/tools/Function_Inspector.adoc[Function Inspector Tool].

====

== CAS Syntax

Min( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Unlike in the Algebra View, this syntax will give the minimum over the interval, including endpoints

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Min(x^2,-1,2)++` yields the point _(0,0)_
* `++Min(-x^2,-1,2)++` yields the point _(2,-4)_
