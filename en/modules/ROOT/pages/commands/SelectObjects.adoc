SelectObjects( )::
  Deselects all selected objects.
SelectObjects( <Object>, <Object>, ... )::
  Deselects all objects and selects objects passed as parameters. All parameters must be
  xref:/Labels_and_Captions.adoc[labeled] objects.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* Let _A_, _B_ and _C_ be points. `++SelectObjects(A, B, C)++` selects points _A_, _B_ and _C_.
* The command `++SelectObjects(Midpoint(A, B))++` has no effect, besides deselecting all selected objects.
