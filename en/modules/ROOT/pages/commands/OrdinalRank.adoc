OrdinalRank( <List> )::
  Returns a list, whose _i_-th element is the rank of _i_-th element of list _L_ (rank of element is its position in
  xref:/commands/Sort.adoc[Sort](L)). If there are more equal elements in _L_ which occupy positions from _k_ to _l_ in
  Sort[L], ranks from _k_ to _l_ are associated with these elements.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++OrdinalRank({4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2})++` returns _{5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3}_
* `++OrdinalRank({3, 2, 2, 1})++` returns _{4, 2, 3, 1}_
