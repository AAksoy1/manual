Factors( <Polynomial> )::
  Gives a list of lists of the type _{factor, exponent}_ such that the product of all these factors raised to the power
  of the corresponding exponents equals the given polynomial. The factors are sorted by degree in ascending order.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Factors(x^8 - 1)++` yields _{{x - 1, 1}, {x + 1, 1}, {x^2 + 1, 1}, {x^4 + 1, 1}}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

Not all of the factors are irreducible over the reals.

====

Factors( <Number> )::
  Gives matrix of the type stem:[\left( \begin{array}{ll} prime_1 & exponent_1 \\ prime_2 & exponent_2 \\prime_3 &
  exponent_3 \\ \end{array} \right) ] such that the product of all these primes raised to the power of the
  corresponding _exponents_ equals the given number. The primes are sorted in ascending order.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Factors(1024)++` yields _( 2 10 )_, since stem:[1024 = 2^{10}].
* `++Factors(42)++` yields stem:[\left( \begin{array}{ll} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \\7 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right) ], since
stem:[42 = 2^1・3^1・7^1].

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Factors(a^8 - 1)++` yields stem:[\left( \begin{array}{cc} a - 1 & 1 \\ a +1 & 1 \\a^2 + 1& 1 \\a^4 + 1& 1 \\
\end{array} \right)].
