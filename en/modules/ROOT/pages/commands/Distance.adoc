Distance( <Point>, <Object> )::
  Yields the shortest distance between a point and an object.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++ Distance((2, 1), x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1)++` yields _1_
* `++Distance((2, 1, 2), (1, 3, 0)) ++` yields _3_
* Let _f_ be a function and _A_ be a point. `++Distance(A, f)++` yields the distance between _A_ and _(x(A), f(x(A)))_, that is the distance between point _A_ and `++ClosestPoint(f, A)++`.

====

[NOTE]
====

The command works for points, segments, lines, conics, functions, and implicit curves. For functions, it uses a
numerical algorithm which works better for polynomials. 

====

Distance( <Line>, <Line> )::
  Yields the distance between two lines.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Distance(y = x + 3, y = x + 1)++` yields _1.41_
* `++Distance(y = 3x + 1, y = x + 1)++` yields _0_
* Let _a: X = (-4, 0, 0) + λ*(4, 3, 0)_ and _b: X = (0, 0, 0) + λ*(0.8, 0.6, 0)_.  `++Distance(a, b)++` yields _2.4_

====

[NOTE]
====

The distance between intersecting lines is _0_. Thus, this command is only interesting for parallel lines.

====

Distance( <Plane>, <Plane> )::
  Yields the distance between the two planes.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _eq1: x + y + 2z = 1_ and _eq2: 2x + 2y + 4z = -2_.  `++Distance(eq1, eq2)++` yields _0.82_

====

[NOTE]
====

The distance between intersecting planes is 0. Thus, this command is only meaningful for parallel planes.
