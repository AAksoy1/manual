This tool is available only in the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view
spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Spreadsheet_View.adoc[Spreadsheet View], and it can be used in two possible ways:

* Select a destination cell, select the tool, then select a cell range. The maximum value of the selected cells will be displayed in the destination cell.
* Select a cell range containing more than one cell, then select the tool. 
** If the range has multiple rows, the maximum value of each column will be displayed below each column. If you need to calculate the maximum value of rows, hold [.kcode]#Shift# while selecting the tool: the maximum value of each row will be displayed to the right of the selected data.
** If the range has only one row, the maximum value will be displayed in the first free cell to the right of the selected data.
