Activate the tool, then select consecutively at least three existing points (or click at least three distinct positions in the _Graphics View_) which will be the vertices of the polygon. Click the first vertex again to "close" the polygon.

Holding down the [.kcode]#Alt# (MacOS : [.kcode]##option##) key after selecting a vertex of the polygon allows to create the next vertex such that the side between these two points makes with the preceding side an angle that is a multiple of 15Â°.
