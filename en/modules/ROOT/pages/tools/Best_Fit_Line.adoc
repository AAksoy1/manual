ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then:

* Create a xref:/Selecting_objects.adoc[selection rectangle] containing just points to create the best fit line of the selected points

or


* Select a xref:/Lists.adoc[list of points] in _Algebra View_ to create the best fit line of the points in the list.

[NOTE]
====

* It is also possible do the reverse: selecting points with a rectangle or from _Algebra View_, then activating the tool to create the best fit line of the selected points.
* See also the xref:/commands/FitLine.adoc[FitLine] command.
