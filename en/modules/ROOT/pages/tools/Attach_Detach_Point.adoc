ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then:

* Select a xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free] point, then a xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[path] or a xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[region] to *attach* the point to the selected object. An _attached_ point can be moved only within the object, using the image:22px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode move.svg,width=22,height=22]xref:/tools/Move.adoc[Move Tool].

* Select a point which is currently bounded to a path or region to *detach* the point from its constraint and set it free.

[NOTE]
====

* You can also use xref:/commands/Point.adoc[Point Command] and xref:/commands/PointIn.adoc[PointIn Command] to attach a point to a curve or surface. 
* See also xref:/commands/CopyFreeObject.adoc[CopyFreeObject Command].
