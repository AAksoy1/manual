== Graphics View

Activate the tool, then in image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View] drag a selection rectangle and enclose the objects that must be in the list. Objects must be of the same type.
The order of the selection-activation operations is irrelevant.

== Spreadsheet View

Select a group of cells containing objects of the same type in the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Spreadsheet_View.adoc[Spreadsheet View], then activate the tool. The appearing dialog window allows to assign a name to the list, order the objects by rows or columns, and decide whether the objects in the list will be _dependent_ or _free_. The default option is _dependent_: this means that any change to the content of the cells will be applied also to the list of the contents of these cells.
