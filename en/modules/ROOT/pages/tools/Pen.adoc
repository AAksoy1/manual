The _Pen Tool_ creates freehand notes and drawings in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View]. This makes the _Pen Tool_ particularly useful
when using GeoGebra for presentations or with multimedia interactive whiteboards. To add a freehand note onto a region
of the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_, activate the
tool and draw using your finger or a pen (touch devices), or use a mouse while pressing and holding the leftbutton and releasing it when done (non-touch devices).

GeoGebra stores the note you traced in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphic View_ as a _stroke_ object, to which it is possible to apply some actions and geometric transformations (e.g. move, rotate, reflect,...).

The default colour of the pen is black, but the pen properties (colour, style, and thickness) can be changed using the
xref:/Style_Bar.adoc[Styling Bar].

== Erasing

To erase a portion of your note created with the _Pen Tool_ in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_, select the xref:/tools/Delete.adoc[Delete Tool] and move your finger (touch devices) or the mouse pointer while pressing and holding the left button over the part you want to erase. 
For non-touch devices it is also possible to erase part of a note by pressing and holding the right mouse button while moving the cursor over it and releasing the button when done. 

To delete a pen _stroke_ completely, select _Delete_ in the xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu] of the object in _Algebra View_ or _Graphics View_.
