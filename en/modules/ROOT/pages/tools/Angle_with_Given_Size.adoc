Activate the tool, then select two existing points or click/tap two distinct positions in the _Graphics View_ to specify a point on the initial side and the vertex of the angle, respectively. Finally enter the angle size into the displayed input box. 


[NOTE]
====

* This tool creates also a new point, that with the already specified vertex defines the terminal side of the angle.
* See also the xref:/commands/Angle.adoc[Angle] command
