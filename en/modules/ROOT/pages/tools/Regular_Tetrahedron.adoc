Activate the tool, then:

* Select or create two points in the _xOy plane_ to obtain a regular tetrahedron with one edge defined by the two given points, 
and lying on the _xOy_ plane. The third vertex will be created automatically to form an equilateral triangle on the xOy plane.

or

* Select or create two points having the same _z_-coordinate, _z=c_, to obtain a regular tetrahedron 
with one edge of the base defined by the two given points, and lying on the plane _z = c_. 
The third vertex will be created automatically to form an equilateral triangle on the plane ( _z=c_ ).

or

* Select two points having different z-coordinates to obtain a regular tetrahedron
with one edge defined by the two given points. The tool will create the third vertex automatically, with a _z_-coordinate that is the average of the _z_-coordinates of the given points. 

[NOTE]
====

* The first two points are xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free] points, 
but the third point is xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[dependent]. 
When dragging the third point, the tetrahedron rotates around the edge defined by the first two points.
* See also xref:/commands/Tetrahedron.adoc[Tetrahedron] command.
