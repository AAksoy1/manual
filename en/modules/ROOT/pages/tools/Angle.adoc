= Angle Tool
:page-en: tools/Angle
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then create an angle as follows:

* Select three existing points or click/tap three distinct positions in the _Graphics View_ to create the angle with vertex at the second point and sides defined by the other two points.
* Select two segments to create the angle between them.
* Select two lines to create the angle between them.
* Select two vectors to create the angle between them.
* Select a polygon to create all its interior angles.

[NOTE]
====

* Angles are created with _counterclockwise_ orientation. Therefore, the selection order of objects is relevant for
the _Angle_ tool. Use the drop-down list in the _Basic_ tab of the xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog] of an angle to limit its size within given intervals.
* See also the xref:/commands/Angle.adoc[Angle] command.
