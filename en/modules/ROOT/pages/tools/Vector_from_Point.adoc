ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then select a point and a vector to create the vector with the selected initial point, and direction and magnitude equal to the selected vector ones. 

This means that by selecting an existing point _A_ and a vector _v_, this tool creates the new point _B = A + v_ as well as the vector from _A_ to _B_.
