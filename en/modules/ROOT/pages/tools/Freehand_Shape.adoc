= Freehand Shape Tool
:page-en: tools/Freehand_Shape
ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

The Freehand Shape Tool lets you either sketch a xref:/Functions.adoc[function], or you can draw a freehand circle,
segment or polygon and it will be recognized and converted to an exact shape. If a function _f_ is created, you can
compute its value at certain point, place a point on it or perform some transformations. Derivatives for these functions
are not supported (tangents are supported as a numerical approximation)

[NOTE]
====

* You can use all the curve fitting commands on functions created by this Tool, e.g.
xref:/commands/FitSin.adoc[FitSin_Command]
* You can use the xref:/commands/Integral.adoc[Integral] command on functions created with this tool e.g.
`++Integral(f, 1, 5)++` to shade under it and find the area
