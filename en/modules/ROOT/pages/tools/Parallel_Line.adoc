ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

Activate the tool, then select a line (or a segment) and a point to create the straight line through the point and parallel to the selected line (or segment).

[NOTE]
====

* The line (or segment) must be already existing in the construction. The point can also be created on the fly with a click (or a tap) in the _Graphics View_.
* The created parallel line has the same direction as the selected line or segment.
* See also the xref:/commands/Line.adoc[Line] command.
