= Freehand Function Tool

ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: /en/modules/ROOT/assets/images]

The Freehand Function Tool lets you sketch a xref:/Functions.adoc[function]. Once a function is created, you can compute
its value at certain point, place a point on it or perform some transformations. Derivatives for these functions are not
supported (tangents are supported as a numerical approximation)

[NOTE]
====

* You can use all the curve fitting commands on functions created by this Tool, e.g.
xref:/commands/FitSin.adoc[FitSin_Command]
* You can use the xref:/commands/Integral.adoc[Integral] command on functions created with this tool e.g.
`++Integral(f, 1, 5)++` to shade under it and find the area
