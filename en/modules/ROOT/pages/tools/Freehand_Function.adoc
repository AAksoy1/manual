* It is possible to create points on them.
* It is not possible to calculate their derivatives.
* It is possible to apply all the curve fitting commands, e.g. xref:/commands/FitSin.adoc[FitSin_Command].
* It is possible to apply the xref:/commands/Integral.adoc[Integral] command e.g. `++Integral(f, 1, 5)++` to shade and calculate areas.
