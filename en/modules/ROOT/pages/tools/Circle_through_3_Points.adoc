Activate the tool, then select three existing points or click three distinct positions in the _Graphics View_ to create the circle through these points.

[NOTE]
====

* If the points are collinear, the circle degenerates to the line these three points belong to.
* See also the xref:/commands/Circle.adoc[Circle] command.
