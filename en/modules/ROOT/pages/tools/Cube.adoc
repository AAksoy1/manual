Activate the tool, then:

* Select or create two points in the _xOy_ plane to obtain a cube with one edge defined by the two given points, and lying on the _xOy_ plane.

or

* Select two points having the same _z_-coordinate, _z=c_, to obtain a cube with one edge of the base defined by the two given points, and lying on the plane _z = c_. The cube can be rotated around the specified edge by dragging the free vertex of the base, created automatically.

or

* Select two points having different z-coordinates to obtain a cube with the edge of one face defined by the two given points and some edges parallel to the _xOy_ plane. The cube can be rotated around the specified edge by dragging the free vertex of the base, created automatically.
