In the image:16px-Menu_view_spreadsheet.svg.png[Menu view spreadsheet.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Spreadsheet_View.adoc[Spreadsheet View], select a set of cells that will form the coordinate pairs across rows or columns and activate the tool.

The appearing dialog window allows you to name the list of points, select whether these points will be free or dependent objects, and choose the assignment method for _x_ and _y_ coordinates: X→Y means that the data in the first selected column will be the _x_-coordinates of the points, and the data in the second column will be the y-coordinates and viceversa for Y→X. 

A preview panel shows the list created with the current settings.
