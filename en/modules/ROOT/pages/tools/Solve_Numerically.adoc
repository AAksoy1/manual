This tool can be used only in image:16px-Menu_view_cas.svg.png[Menu view cas.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/CAS_View.adoc[CAS View].

Type in the equation you want to solve and press [.kcode]#Enter# to confirm. Then select the equation and activate the
tool.

This tool allows you to solve a system of equations as well. Type each equation in separate cells, then select them all
and activate the tool to obtain the solution of the system.

[NOTE]
====

For non-polynomial equations, a starting value for the iteration will be added, eg `++x = 1++`. See the
xref:/commands/NSolve.adoc[NSolve Command] for more details.
