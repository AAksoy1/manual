InverseFDistribution( <Numerator Degrees of Freedom>, <Denominator Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution[F-distribution] at probability _p_, where the F-distribution is given by
  the degrees of freedom.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is random variable with F-distribution.
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
