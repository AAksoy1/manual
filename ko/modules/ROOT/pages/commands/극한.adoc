Limit( <Function>, <Value> )::
  Computes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function[limit] of the function for the given value of the main
  function variable. (This may also yield infinity.)

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Limit((x^2 + x) /  x^2, +∞)++` yields _1_.

====

[NOTE]
====

Not all limits can be calculated by GeoGebra, so _undefined_ will be returned in those cases (as well as when the
correct result is undefined).

Limit( <Expression>, <Variable>, <Value> )::

[EXAMPLE]
====

you need to use xref:/s_index_php?title=LimitAbove_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[LimitAbove] or
xref:/s_index_php?title=LimitBelow_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[LimitBelow], for example
`++LimitAbove(If(x>1, x^2, -2x), 1)++`
