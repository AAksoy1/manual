Min( <List> )::
  Returns the minimum of the numbers within the list.
Min( <Interval> )::
  Returns the lower bound of the interval.
Min( <Number>, <Number> )::
  Returns the minimum of the two given numbers.
Min( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Calculates (numerically) the *local* minimum point for function in the given interval. Function should be continuous
  and have only one _local_ minimum point in the interval.
Min( <List of Data>, <List of Frequencies> )::
  Returns the minimum of the list of data with corresponding frequencies.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {0, 3, 4, 2, 3})++` yields 2, the lowest number of the first list whose frequency is greater
than 0.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min(exp(x) x^3,-4,-2)++` creates the point (-3, -1.34425) .

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min(12, 15)++` yields _12_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min(2 < x < 3)++` yields _2_ .

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Min({-2, 12, -23, 17, 15})++` yields _-23_.

[NOTE]

For polynomials you should use the xref:/s_index_php?title=Extremum_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Extremum
Command].

====

[NOTE]
====

Open and closed intervals are not distinguished.

====

[NOTE]
====

If the input consists of non-numeric objects, then this command considers the numbers associated with those objects. If
you have a list of segments for example, the command Min( <List> ) will yield the minimum segment length.

====

[NOTE]
====

* If you want the minimum of two functions `++f(x)++` and `++g(x)++` then you can define
`++(f(x) + g(x) - abs(f(x) - g(x)))/2++`
* See also xref:/s_index_php?title=Max_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Max Command],
