InverseGamma( <Alpha>, <Beta>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution[gamma
  distribution] at probability _p_, where the gamma distribution is given by parameters _Alpha_ and _Beta_.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is random variable with gamma distribution.
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
