InverseWeibull( <Shape>, <Scale>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution[Weibull
  distribution] at _p_, where the Weibull distribution is given by shape parameter _k_ and scale parameter _λ_. In other
  words, finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is random variable with Weibull distribution. Probability _p_
  must be from [0,1].
