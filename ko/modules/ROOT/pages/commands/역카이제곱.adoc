InverseChiSquared( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution[Chi
  squared distribution] at probability _p_, where the Chi squared distribution has given _d_ degrees of freedom.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is Chi squared random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
