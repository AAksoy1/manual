Classes( <List of Data>, <Start>, <Width of Classes> )::
  Gives a list of class boundaries. The first boundary (min) is equal to _Start_, the last boundary (max) will be at
  least the maximum of the _List_ and the boundaries will be equally spaced between min and max.
Classes( <List of Data>, <Number of Classes> )::
  Gives a list of class boundaries. The first boundary (min) is equal to the minimum of the _List_, the last boundary
  (max) will be the maximum of the _List_ and the boundaries will be equally spaced between min and max.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Classes({1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}, 3)++` gives \{1, 4, 7, 10}

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Classes({0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.1}, 0, 1)++` gives \{0, 1, 2}

[NOTE]
====

By convention this uses the a ≤ x < b rule for each class except for the last class which is a ≤ x ≤ b
