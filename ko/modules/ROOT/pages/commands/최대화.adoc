Maximize( <Dependent number>, <Free number> )::
  Calculates the free number which gives the maximal value of the dependent number. The free number must be a slider and
  the slider interval will be used as the search interval. The relationship should be continuous and have only one
  _local_ maximum point in the interval. If the construction is complicated, this command might return ? to avoid using
  too much processor time.
