Locus( <Point Creating Locus Line Q>, <Point P>)::
  Returns the locus curve of the point _Q_, which depends on the point _P_.
Locus( <Point Creating Locus Line Q>, <Slider t>)::
  Returns the locus curve of the point _Q_, which depends on the values assumed by the slider _t_.
Locus( <Slopefield>, <Point> )::
  Returns the locus curve which equates to the slopefield at the given point.
Locus( <f(x, y)>, <Point> )::
  Returns the locus curve which equates to the solution of the differential equation stem:[\frac\{dy}\{dx}=f(x,y)] in
  the given point. The solution is calculated numerically.

[NOTE]
====

Point _P_ needs to be a point on an object (e. g. line, segment, circle).

Loci are specific object types, and appear as
xref:/s_index_php?title=Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[auxiliary objects]. Besides
Locus command, they are the result of some

xref:/s_index_php?title=SolveODE_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[SolveODE Command]. Loci are
xref:/s_index_php?title=Geometric_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[paths] and can be used within path-related commands
such as xref:/s_index_php?title=Point_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Point]. Their properties depend on how they
were obtained, see e.g. xref:/s_index_php?title=Perimeter_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Perimeter Command] and
xref:/s_index_php?title=First_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[First Command].
