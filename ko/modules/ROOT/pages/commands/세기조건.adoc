CountIf( <Condition>, <List> )::
  Counts the number of elements in the list satisfying the condition.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++CountIf(x < 3, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5})++` gives you the number _2_.
* `++CountIf(x < 3, A1:A10)++`, where _A1:A10_ is a range of cells in the spreadsheet, counts all cells whose values are
less than _3_.

====

[NOTE]
====

For list of numbers arbitrary condition may be used. For list of other objects one can use only conditions of the form
`++x==constant++` or `++x!=constant++`.

====

CountIf( <Condition>, <Variable>, <List> )::
  As above, using a more flexible syntax.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Given points _P_, _Q_, _R_ `++CountIf(x(A) < 3, A, {P, Q, R})++` will count only the points whose x-coordinate is less
than _3_. The variable _A_ is replaced in turn with _P_ then _Q_ then _R_ for the check. Therefore
`++CountIf(x(A) < 3, A, {(0, 1), (4, 2), (2, 2)})++` yields the number _2_.
