SetCoords( <Object>, <x>, <y> )::
  Changes cartesian coordinates of
  xref:/s_index_php?title=Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[free] objects. This command
  uses values of the coordinates, not their definitions, therefore the object stays free.

[NOTE]
====

This also works for Points on paths and in regions. The Point will be moved to the closest possible place

[NOTE]

This command now works for Sliders, Buttons, Checkboxes, Input Boxes, Images. If "Absolute Screen Position" is selected
then _x_, _y_ are in screen pixels.
