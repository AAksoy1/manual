Relation( <List> )::
  Shows a message box that gives you information about the relation between two or more (up to 4) objects.
Relation( <Object>, <Object> )::
  Shows a message box that gives you information about the relation between two objects.

This command allows you to find out whether

* two lines are perpendicular
* two lines are parallel
* two (or more) objects are equal
* a point lies on a line or conic
* a line is tangent or a passing line to a conic
* three points are collinear
* three lines are concurrent (or parallel)
* four points are concyclic (or collinear).

Some of these checks can also be performed symbolically. If GeoGebra supports symbolic check for a certain property, the
"More" button appears. By clicking it, GeoGebra may provide more information whether the property is true in general
(eventually under certain conditions).
