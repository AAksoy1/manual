UpdateConstruction( )::
  Recomputes all objects (random numbers are regenerated). Same as [.kcode]#F9# or [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#R#.

[NOTE]
====

If you want to refresh the view (e.g. to remove xref:/s_index_php?title=Tracing_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[traces] from
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/s_index_php?title=Graphics_View_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Graphics View]) you can use `++ZoomIn(1)++` instead,
which is the same as [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#F#. You may also need
xref:/s_index_php?title=SetActiveView_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[SetActiveView(1)] or
xref:/s_index_php?title=SetActiveView_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[SetActiveView(2)] first if you are using two
Graphics Views.

====

UpdateConstruction( <Number of times> )::
  Performs the command `++UpdateConstruction()++` several times.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++UpdateConstruction(2)++` updates the construction twice (e.g. to record several dice throws to the spreadsheet).
