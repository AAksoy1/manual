LinearEccentricity( <Conic> )::
  Calculates the linear eccentricity of the conic section.
  For ellipses or hyperbolas the command gives the distance between the conic's center and one of its foci, for circles
  it gives 0, and for parabolas gives the distance between its focus and the vertex.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++LinearEccentricity(4x^2 - y^2 + 16x + 20 = 0)++` returns 2.24
