Commands *Solve* and xref:/s_index_php?title=Solutions_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Solutions] solve an equation
or a system of equations over the real numbers symbolically. To solve equations numerically, use the
xref:/s_index_php?title=NSolve_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[NSolve Command]. For solving equations in complex
numbers see xref:/s_index_php?title=CSolve_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[CSolve Command].

Solve( <Equation in x> )::
  Solves a given equation for the main variable and returns a list of all solutions.
Solve( <Equation>, <Variable> )::
  Solves an equation for a given unknown variable and returns a list of all solutions.
Solve( <List of Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Solves a set of equations for a given set of unknown variables and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solve({x = 4 x + y , y + x = 2}, {x, y})++` yields _( x = -1, y = 3 )_, the sole solution of _x = 4x + y_ and _y +
x = 2_
* `++Solve({2a^2 + 5a + 3 = b, a + b = 3}, {a, b})++` yields _\{\{a = 0, b = 3}, \{a = -3, b = 6}}_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solve(x * a^2 = 4a, a)++` yields \{stem:[a = \frac\{4}\{x}, a = 0]}, the solutions of _xa^2^ = 4a_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Solve(x^2 = 4x)++` yields _\{x = 4, x = 0}_, the solutions of _x^2^ = 4x_.

====

Solve( <Equation>, <Variable> , <List of assumptions>)::
  Solves an equation for a given unknown variable with the list of assumptions and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solve(u *x < a,x, u>0)++` yields _\{x < a / u}_, the solution of _u *x < a_ assuming that _u>0_
* `++Solve(u *x < a,x, {u<0, a<0})++` yields _\{x > a / u}_.

====

Solve( <List of Parametric Equations>, <List of Variables> )::
  Solves a set of parametric equations for a given set of unknown variables and returns a list of all solutions.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Solve({(x, y) = (3, 2) + t*(5, 1), (x, y) = (4, 1) + s*(1, -1)}, {x, y, t, s})++` yields _\{\{x = 3, y = 2, t = 0,
s = -1}}_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* The right hand side of equations (in any of the above syntaxes) can be omitted. If the right hand side is missing, it
is treated as 0.
* Sometimes you need to do some manipulation to allow the automatic solver to work, for example
`++ Solve(TrigExpand(sin(5/4 π + x) - cos(x - 3/4 π) = sqrt(6) * cos(x) - sqrt(2)))++`.
* For piecewise-defined functions, you will need to use
xref:/s_index_php?title=NSolve_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[NSolve]
