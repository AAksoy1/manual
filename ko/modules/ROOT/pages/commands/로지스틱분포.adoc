Logistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, x )::
  Creates cumulative density function (cdf) of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution[logistic
  distribution] with parameters mean _μ_ and scale _s_.
Logistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, x, <Boolean Cumulative> )::
  If _Cumulative_ is true, creates cumulative distribution function of logistic distribution, otherwise creates pdf of
  logistic distribution.
Logistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, <Variable Value> )::
  Calculates the value of cumulative distribution function of logistic distribution at variable value _v_, i.e. the
  probability _P(X ≤ v)_ where _X_ is a random variable with logistic distribution given by parameters mean _μ_ and
  scale _s_.

[NOTE]
====

Returns the probability for a given _x_-coordinate's value (or area under the logistic distribution curve to the left of
the given _x_-coordinate).
