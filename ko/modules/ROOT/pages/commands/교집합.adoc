Intersection( <List>, <List> )::
  Gives you a new list containing all elements that are part of both lists.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++list1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}++` and
`++list2 = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30}++` be two lists. `++Intersection(list1, list2)++`
yields a new list _list3 = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}_.
