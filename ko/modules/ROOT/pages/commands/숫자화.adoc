ParseToNumber( <Number>, <String> )::
  Parses the string and stores the result to a
  xref:/s_index_php?title=Numbers_and_Angles_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[number] _a_, which must be defined and
  xref:/s_index_php?title=Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[free] before the command is
  used.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Define `++ a = 3++` and `++ text1 = "6"++`. `++ ParseToNumber(a, text1)++` returns _a = 6_.

[NOTE]
====

* This is a xref:/s_index_php?title=Scripting_Commands_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[scripting command] which only sets the
value of a number once. To convert a text _text1_ into a number which is updated dynamically, use
xref:/s_index_php?title=FromBase_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[FromBase](text1,10).
