Join( <List>, <List>, ... )::
  Joins the two (or more) lists.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Join({5, 4, 3}, {1, 2, 3})++` creates the list _\{5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 3}_.

[NOTE]
====

The new list contains all elements of the initial lists even if they are the same. The elements of the new list are not
re-ordered.

====

Join( <List of Lists> )::
  Joins the sub-lists into one longer list.

* `++Join({{1, 2}})++` creates the list _\{1, 2}_.
* `++Join({{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4}, {8, 7}})++` creates the list _\{1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8, 7}_.
