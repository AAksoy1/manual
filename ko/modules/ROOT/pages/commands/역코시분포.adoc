InverseCauchy( <Median>, <Scale>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution[Cauchy
  distribution] at probability _p_, where the Cauchy distribution is given by median _m_ and scale _s_.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is Cauchy random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
