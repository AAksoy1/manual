Mean( <List of Raw Data> )::
  Calculates the arithmetic mean of list elements.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Mean({1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2})++` yields _a = 2.25_ and
* `++Mean({1, 3, 5, 9, 13})++` yields _a = 6.2_.

====

Mean( <List of Numbers>, <List of Frequencies> )::
  Calculates the weighted mean of the list elements.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++Mean({1, 2, 3, 4}, {6, 1, 3, 6})++` yields _a = 2.56_ and
* `++Mean({1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 1, 3, 6})++` yields _a = 3.27_.
