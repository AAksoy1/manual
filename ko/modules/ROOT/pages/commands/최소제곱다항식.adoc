FitPoly( <List of Points>, <Degree of Polynomial> )::
  Calculates the regression polynomial of degree _n_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitPoly({(-1, -1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 5)}, 3)++` yields _f(x) = x^3^ - 1 x^2^ + 1_.

====

FitPoly( <Freehand Function>, <Degree of Polynomial> )::
  Calculates the regression polynomial of degree _n_ for a function drawn by the
  xref:/s_index_php?title=Freehand_Shape_Tool_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Freehand Shape Tool].

* For order _n_ there must be at least _n + 1_ Points in the list.
