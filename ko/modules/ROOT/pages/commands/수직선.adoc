PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Line> )::
  Creates a line through the point perpendicular to the given line.
PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Segment> )::
  Creates a line through the point perpendicular to the given segment.
PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Vector> )::
  Creates a line through the point perpendicular to the given vector.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++u = Vector((5, 3), (1, 1))++` and `++A = (-2, 0)++` a point. `++PerpendicularLine(A, u)++` yields the line _c: 2x
+ y = -4_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let _c_ be the segment between the two points _A_ = (-3, 3) and _B_ = (0, 1). `++PerpendicularLine(A, c)++` yields the
line _d: -3x + 2y = 15_.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

Let `++c: -3x + 4y = -6++` be a line and `++A = (-2, -3)++` a point. `++PerpendicularLine(A, c)++` yields the line _d_:
-4__x__ - 3__y__ = 17.

[NOTE]
====

For 3D objects a third argument is added to this command to specify the behavior: if 2D view is active, plane _z=0_ is
used as third argument, if 3D view is active, _space_ is used instead. See PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Line>, <Context>
) further below for details.

PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Plane> )::
  Creates a perpendicular line to the plane through the given point.
PerpendicularLine( <Line> , <Line> )::
  Creates a perpendicular line to the given lines through the intersection point of the two lines.
PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Direction>, <Direction> )::
  Creates a perpendicular line to the given directions (that can be lines or vectors) through the given point.
PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Line>, <Context> )::
  Creates a perpendicular line to the line through the point and depending on the context.
  * PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Line>, <Plane> ) creates a perpendicular line to the given line through the point and
  parallel to the plane.
  * PerpendicularLine( <Point>, <Line>, space ) creates a perpendicular line to the given line through the point. The
  two lines have an intersection point. This command yields undefined if the point is on the line in 3D.
