RandomPolynomial( <Degree> , <Minimum for Coefficients>, <Maximum for Coefficients> )::
  Returns a randomly generated polynomial in _x_ of degree _d_, whose (integer) coefficients are in the range from
  _minimum_ to _maximum_, both included.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++RandomPolynomial(0, 1, 2)++` yields either _1_ or _2_.
* `++RandomPolynomial(2, 1, 2)++` yields a random polynomial with a degree of two and only _1_ and _2_ as coefficients,
for example _2x^2^ + x + 1_.

RandomPolynomial( <Variable>, <Degree> , <Minimum for Coefficients>, <Maximum for Coefficients> )::
  Returns a randomly generated polynomial in _Variable_ of degree _d_, whose (integer) coefficients are in the range
  from _minimum_ to _maximum_, both included.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++RandomPolynomial(a, 0, 1, 2)++` yields either _1_ or _2_.
* `++RandomPolynomial(a, 2, 1, 2)++` yields a random polynomial with a degree of two and only _1_ and _2_ as
coefficients, for example _2a^2^ + a + 1_.

[NOTE]
====

In both cases if _minimum_ or _maximum_ are not integers, _round(minimum)_ and _round(maximum)_ are used instead.
