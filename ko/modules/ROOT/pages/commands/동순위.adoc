TiedRank( <List> )::
  Returns a list, whose _i_-th element is the rank of _i_-th element of the given list _L_ (rank of element is its
  position in xref:/s_index_php?title=Sort_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Sort](L)). If there are more equal
  elements in _L_ which occupy positions from _k_ to _l_ in Sort[L], the mean of the ranks from _k_ to _l_ are
  associated with these elements.

[EXAMPLE]
====

* `++TiedRank({4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2})++` returns \{5.5, 1, 2.5, 4, 5.5, 2.5}.
* `++TiedRank({3, 2, 2, 1})++` returns \{4, 2.5, 2.5, 1}.
