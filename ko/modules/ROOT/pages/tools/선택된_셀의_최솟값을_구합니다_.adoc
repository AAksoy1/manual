* Select a destination cell, then choose this tool and after that select a cell range. Minimum of selected cells will
occur in destination cell.
* Select a cell range containing more than one cell and then choose this tool. If the cell range has multiple rows,
minimum of each column will be inserted under this column. If it has only one row, minimum of the row will be inserted
to the right of the selection. If you hold [.kcode]#Shift# when selecting the icon of this tool, the minimum of each row
