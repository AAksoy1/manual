First, select the center point of the circular arc. Then, select the starting point of the arc and another point that
specifies the length of the arc.

[NOTE]
====

* The Arc is always drawn counter-clockwise.
* While the second selected point always lies on the circular arc, the third point does not need to lie on it.
