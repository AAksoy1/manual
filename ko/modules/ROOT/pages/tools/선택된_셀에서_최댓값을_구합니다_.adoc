* Select a destination cell, then choose this tool and after that select a cell range. Maximum of selected cells will
occur in destination cell.

maximum of each column will be inserted under this column. If it has only one row, maximum of the row will be inserted
to the right of the selection. If you hold [.kcode]#Shift# when selecting the icon of this tool, the maximum of each row
