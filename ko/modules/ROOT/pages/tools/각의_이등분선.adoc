Angle bisectors can be defined in two ways:

* Selecting three points _A_, _B_, and _C_ produces the angle bisector of the enclosed angle, where point _B_ is the
apex.
* Selecting two lines produces their two angle bisectors.

[NOTE]
====

* The direction vectors of all angle bisectors have length 1
* See also xref:/s_index_php?title=AngleBisector_Command_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[AngleBisector] command.
