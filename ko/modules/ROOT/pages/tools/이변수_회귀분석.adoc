Select two columns with paired number data in the spreadsheet, then activate this tool to open a dialog that creates
graphs and calculates two-variable statistics from the data. The dialog has four panels: a statistics panel, a data
panel and two graph panels. Only one graph panel is visible when the dialog is first opened. Use the options menu to
show the others.

The dialog opens with a scatterplot of the selected data. In the drop down menu below the graph you can select different
regression models for the data. When a model is selected its graph is drawn on the plot and the equation is shown
beneath.
