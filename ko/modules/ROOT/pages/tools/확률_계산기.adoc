이 도구를 클릭하면 확률분포를 계산하고 시각화를 위한 대화상자가 나타납니다. (아래 문장을 번역한 것입니다. - 우리말에
적합하게 번역하고 기타 기호를 건드리면 안됩니다.) Clicking on this tool opens a dialog for calculating and graphing
probability distributions.

* To change a distribution click on the distribution drop down menu and choose a one from the list. Then adjust the
parameters for the distribution in the adjacent text boxes.
* To calculate a probability click on the probability drop down menu and select the interval type. Then adjust the
interval in the adjacent text boxes. You can also find probabilities by moving the points on the x-axis in the graph.

*Options*

The probability calculator has a stylebar with options to change settings and export the graph. To open the style bar,
click on the open button in the title bar or double click the title bar. From the style bar you can change the decimal
rounding format, use cumulative probability and export the graphics.

*Drag and Drop*

When the mouse is positioned at the top of the graphics screen the cursor will change to a hand cursor. From here you
can drag the plot into GraphicsView 1 or 2 to create a new plot or you can drag an image of the plot into another
application that will accept images.
