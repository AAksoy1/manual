With this tool you can create static and dynamic text or LaTeX formulas in the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Graphics_View_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Graphics View].

At first, you need to specify the location of the text in one of the following ways:

* Click in the Graphics View to create a new text at this location.
* Click on a point to create a new text that is attached to this point.

[NOTE]
====

You may specify the position of a text as absolute on screen or relative to the coordinate system on tab Basic of the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Properties_Dialog_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Properties Dialog].

====

Then, a dialog appears where you may enter your text, which can be static, dynamic, or mixed.

The text you type directly in the _Edit_ field is considered as static, i.e. it's not affected by the objects
modifications. If you need to create a dynamic text, which displays the changing values of an object, select the related
object from the _Objects_ drop-down list. The corresponding name is shown, enclosed in a grey box, in the _Edit_ field,
and its value is displayed in the _Preview_ box. Right-clicking on the grey box allows you to select "Definition" or
"Value" for each dynamic object.

It is also possible to perform algebraic operations or apply specific commands to these objects, just clicking in the
grey box and typing the algebraic operation or GeoGebra
xref:/s_index_php?title=Text_Commands_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[text command] desired. The results of these operations
will be dynamically shown in the resulting text, in the Graphics View.

Best visual results are obtained when using LaTex formatting for the formulas. Its use is simple and intuitive: just
check the _LaTeX Formula_ box, and select the desired formula template from the drop-down list. You can also select a
variety of mathematical symbols and operators from the _Symbols_ drop-down list.
