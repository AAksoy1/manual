To create an html file on your computer, you have to choose the
image:Export-html.png[Export-html.png,width=32,height=32]__Export as Worksheet__ tab.

* At the top of the export window you can enter the Title, Author and Date for your Dynamic Worksheet.

* Tab General allows you to add some text above and below the dynamic construction (e. g., a description of the
construction and some tasks).

* Tab Advanced allows you to change the functionality of the dynamic construction (e. g., show a reset icon, double
click to open the GeoGebra application window and browser features) as well as to modify the user interface shown in the
interactive applet (e. g., show the xref:/s_index_php?title=Toolbar_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Toolbar], modify height
and width, enabling saving and printing, and others).

The exported HTML file (e. g. circle.html) can be viewed with any Internet browser (e. g. Mozilla, Internet Explorer,
Safari). In order to let the dynamic construction work, Java has to be installed on the computer. If you want to use
your Dynamic Worksheet in your school's computer network, ask your local network administrator to install Java on the
computers. Make sure that your Java install includes the plugin for browsers.

== Advanced settings

*Functionality*:

* _Enable right click, zooming and keyboard editing features_: By selecting this feature you will be able to right click
objects or the drawing pad in order to access the features of the context menu (e.g.
xref:/s_index_php?title=Show_Hide_Object_Tool_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[show / hide object or label],
xref:/s_index_php?title=Tracing_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[trace on / off],
xref:/s_index_php?title=Properties_Dialog_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Properties dialog]). It is also possible to use the
common xref:/s_index_php?title=Keyboard_Shortcuts_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[keyboard shortcuts].
* _Enable dragging of labels_: By selecting this feature you are able to drag labels of points or objects.
* _Show icon to reset construction_: A reset icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the interactive applet
allowing your students to reset the interactive figure to its initial state.
* _Use Browser for JavaScript Scripts_: JavaScipt Scripts are enabled. This allows your browser to show your
construction properly.

*User interface*:

* _Show menubar_: The menubar is displayed within the interactive applet.
* _Enable save, print & undo_: It is possible to provide features for saving, printing and undoing the construction.
Since this allows the applet to access your hard drive and printer,
/s_index_php?title=Reference:Applets_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[signed applets] are used and every user of your applet
is asked to confirm that he trusts it.
* _Show toolbar_: The toolbar is displayed within the interactive applet allowing to use the geometry tools.
* _Show toolbar help_: In combination with the toolbar you can also display the toolbar help within the interactive
applet. If you want to provide geometry tools users of your worksheet can check the toolbar help in order to find out
how to operate the different tools on their own.
* _Show inputbar_: The input field is displayed at the bottom of the interactive applet allowing to use algebraic input
and commands for explorations.
* _Allow rescaling_: When this option is checked, the applet will try to rescale the construction according to the
browser's zoom as well as changing the size of the applet. This option is ignored if there are multiple
xref:/s_index_php?title=Views_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[views] shown in the applet.
* _Width and height of the interactive applet_: You can modify the width and height of the interactive applet.

*Files*:

* _Include *.jar files_: Creates not only the html file, but also the *.jar files.

* _Remove Line Breaks_: removes line breaks from the resulting code. This is needed e.g. when including your applets in
http://wordpress.com[WordPress] but makes the resulting code less friendly for editing.
* _File-Dropdown_: You can choose if the export-file is html, MediaWiki, GoogleGadget or Moodle.
* _Single File_: A dynamic webpage will be created using a single file.
* _Single File (Tabs)_: More than one worksheet can be displayed in the browser, to navigate between the different tasks
by using tabs.
* _Linked Files_: Creates linked dynamic worksheets and provides _Next_ and _Back_ buttons to work on more than one
exercise.

[NOTE]
====

*image:18px-Bulbgraph.png[Note,title="Note",width=18,height=22] Uputa:* The amount of data needed for the applet to load
is *significantly* reduced (400kB rather than 1300kB when using geogebra.org as codebase) when following conditions are
met:

* just one Graphics View used (no Spreadsheet, Algebra View etc)
* there's no menubar, input bar etc
* use Browser for JavaScript is checked
* you don't use any commands which call the CAS eg f'(x), Integral,

Tangent, Expand http://www.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/geogebra/kernel/cas

* you don't use any of these commands:

[NOTE]
====

*image:18px-Bulbgraph.png[Note,title="Note",width=18,height=22] Uputa:* For creating several interactive applets it is
necessary to create more than one construction using _File_ - _New Window_ or [.kcode]#Ctrl# + [.kcode]#N#.

====

[NOTE]
====

You have to use this option if you want your applet to be available without connection to http://geogebra.org.

====

[NOTE]
====

*image:18px-Bulbgraph.png[Note,title="Note",width=18,height=22] Uputa:* If you include the menubar, toolbar, or input
field you might want to adjust the height of the interactive applet.

====

[NOTE]
====

If you reduce the size of the applet important parts of the dynamic worksheets might be invisible for users.

====

[NOTE]
====

* You can edit the Dynamic Worksheet text with many word processing systems (e. g. FrontPage, OpenOffice Writer) by
opening the exported HTML file. You may also edit the Dynamic Worksheet applet by opening the GGB file in GeoGebra and
saving it with the same name afterwards.
* See xref:/s_index_php?title=Embedding_to_CMS_VLE_(Moodle)_and_Wiki_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Embedding to CMS, VLE
(Moodle) and Wiki] for details about exporting GeoGebra applets to these online systems.

====

[NOTE]
====

If the size of your applet is too big to fit on a computer screen with standard resolution (1024 x 768), you may want to
resize it before the actual export as a Dynamic Worksheet.
