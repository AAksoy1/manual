The Properties Dialog allows you to modify properties of objects (e. g., size, color, filling, line style, line
thickness, visibility) as well as automate some object actions using Javascript or GeoGebra Script.

You can open the Properties Dialog in several ways:

* Right click (Mac OS: Ctrl-click) on an object and select image:Menu_Properties.png[Menu
Properties.png,width=16,height=16] Properties… from the appearing Context Menu.

* Select item image:Menu_Properties.png[Menu Properties.png,width=16,height=16] Properties from the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Edit_Menu_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Edit Menu].

* Select the image:Tool_Move.gif[Tool Move.gif,width=32,height=32]
xref:/s_index_php?title=Move_Tool_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Move Tool] and double click on an object in the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Graphics_View_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Graphics View]. In the appearing
xref:/s_index_php?title=Redefine_Dialog_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Redefine Dialog] window, click on the button
Properties….

In the Properties Dialog objects are organized by types (e. g., points, lines, circles) in the list on the left hand
side, which makes it easier to handle large numbers of objects. You need to select one or more objects from this list in
order to change its/their properties.

[NOTE]
====

By clicking on a heading in the list of objects (e. g., Point) you can select all objects of this type and therefore,
quickly change the properties for all these objects.

====

You can modify the xref:/s_index_php?title=Object_Properties_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[properties] of
xref:/s_index_php?title=Selecting_objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[selected objects] using the tabs on the right hand
side (e. g., Basic, Color, Style, Algebra, Advanced, Scripting).

[NOTE]
====

Depending on the selection of objects in the list, a different set of tabs may be available.

====

Close the Properties Dialog when you are done with changing properties of objects.
