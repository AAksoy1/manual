Based on an existing construction you can create your own tools in GeoGebra. After preparing the construction of your
tool, choose Create new tool in the xref:/s_index_php?title=Tools_Menu_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Tools Menu]. In the
appearing dialog you can specify the output and input objects of your tool and choose names for the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Toolbar_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Toolbar] icon and corresponding
xref:/s_index_php?title=Commands_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[command].

[NOTE]
====

Your tool can be used both with the mouse and as a command in the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Input_Bar_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Input Bar]. All tools are automatically saved in your GGB
construction file.
