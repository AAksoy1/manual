There are two types of objects in GeoGebra: free and dependent. Some of them can be defined to be auxiliary.

== Free Objects

_Free Objects_ are objects whose position or value doesn't depend on any other objects. They are created by
xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[direct input] or e.g. image:24px-Mode_point.svg.png[Mode point.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Point.adoc[Point Tool]. They can be moved, unless they are xref:/Object_Properties.adoc[fixed].

== Dependent Objects

_Dependent Objects_ are objects that depend on some other objects. They are created using xref:/Tools.adoc[Tools] and
xref:/Commands.adoc[Commands].

== Auxiliary Objects

_Auxiliary Objects_ are either objects which are defined to be auxiliary by user, or objects which were created by
specific tools, e.g. image:24px-Mode_regularpolygon.svg.png[Mode regularpolygon.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Regular_Polygon.adoc[Regular Polygon Tool]. xref:/Spreadsheet_View.adoc[Spreadsheet] cells are also
considered to be auxiliary. They have their separate place in image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view
algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View].
