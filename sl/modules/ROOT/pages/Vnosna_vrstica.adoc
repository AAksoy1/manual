Input bar is by default located in the bottom of GeoGebra window. You can show it or hide it via
xref:/s_index_php?title=View_Menu_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[View Menu].

It allows you to create and redefine mathematical objects

* directly, using their algebraic representations (e. g., values, coordinates, equations). This representation is shown
in the xref:/s_index_php?title=Algebra_View_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Algebra View]. See
xref:/s_index_php?title=Geometric_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Geometric Objects] and
xref:/s_index_php?title=General_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[General Objects] for details.
* using xref:/s_index_php?title=Commands_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Commands].

== Display Input Bar History

After placing the cursor in the Input Bar you can use the [.kcode]#↑# up and [.kcode]#↓# down arrow keys of your
keyboard in order to navigate through prior input step by step.

== Insert Name, Value, or Definition of an Object into the Input Bar

* *Insert the name of an object*: Activate image:Tool_Move.gif[Tool
Move.gif,width=32,height=32] xref:/s_index_php?title=Move_Tool_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Move Tool] and select the
object whose name you want to insert into the Input Bar. Then, press [.kcode]#F5# on your keyboard.

* *Insert the value of an object*: There are two ways of inserting an object’s value (e. g., (1, 3), 3x – 5y = 12) into
the Input Bar.
** Right click (Mac OS: Ctrl-click) on the object and select item image:Copy_to_Input_Bar.png[Copy to Input
Bar.png,width=16,height=16] Copy to Input Bar from the appearing Context Menu.
** Activate image:Tool_Move.gif[Tool Move.gif,width=32,height=32]
xref:/s_index_php?title=Move_Tool_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Move Tool] and select the object whose value you want to
insert into the Input Bar. Then, press [.kcode]#F4# on your keyboard.

* *Insert the definition of an object*: There are two ways of inserting an object’s definition (e. g., A = (4, 2), c =
Circle[A, B]) into the Input Bar.
** Alt click on the object to insert the object’s definition and delete whatever input might have been in the Input Bar
before.
** Activate image:Tool_Move.gif[Tool Move.gif,width=32,height=32]
xref:/s_index_php?title=Move_Tool_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Move Tool] and select the object whose definition you want
to insert into the Input Bar. Then, press [.kcode]#F3# on your keyboard.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Typing `++A=(1,1)++` creates
xref:/s_index_php?title=Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[free] point A with coordinates
(1,1). Typing `++A=Midpoint[(2,0),(4,0)]++` redefines A: it becomes
xref:/s_index_php?title=Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[dependent] point.

====

[NOTE]
====

The definition of the object replaces any expression you typed into the Input Bar before pressing [.kcode]#F3#.

====

[NOTE]
====

The value of the object is appended to any expression you typed into the Input Bar before pressing [.kcode]#F4#.

====

[NOTE]
====

The name of the object is appended to any expression you typed into the Input Bar before pressing [.kcode]#F5#.

====

[NOTE]
====

Pressing [.kcode]#Enter# at any time toggles the focus between the Input Bar and the
xref:/s_index_php?title=Graphics_View_action=edit_redlink=1.adoc[Graphics View]. This allows you to enter expressions
and commands into the Input Bar without having to click on it with the mouse first.

====

[NOTE]
====

Always press [.kcode]#Enter# after typing algebraic input into the Input Bar.
